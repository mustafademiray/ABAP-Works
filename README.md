Some SAP Report and Function examples.

# SelectionALVtoSmartForm
z table has 4 column. zmd_urn(matnr type), zmd_mktr(numc10 type), zmd_iec(numc1 type connected to domain if its 0 = import, 1 = export), zmd_trh(sydatum type) 
you can send to exact rows into smartform if you dont want to send all alv list.


# MM03 
Classic MM03. But hey, it's a function. (as input, takes ir_matrn(range) and ir_prdha(range), as export gives a lot of things inside on et_list)
